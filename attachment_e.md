|               | Criteria | Evidence  |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| a | assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_a.md |
| b | assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team including a minimum of 5 labor categories from the Development Pool labor categories to design and develop the prototype | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_b.md |
| c | understand what people need, by including people in the prototype development and design process | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_c.md |
| d | used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_d.md |
| e | created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_e.md |
| f | performed usability tests with people | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_f.md |
| g | used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_g.md |
| h | created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_h.md |
| i | used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.) | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_i.md |
| j | deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_j.md |
| k | wrote unit tests for their code | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_k.md |
| l | set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_l.md |
| m | set up or used configuration management | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_m.md |
| n | set up or used continuous monitoring | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_n.md |
| o | deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization) | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_o.md |
| p | provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_p.md |
| q | prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge | https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/criteria_q.md |
