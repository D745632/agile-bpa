# Criteria A - Leadership

####_Assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted._

An experienced [Product Manager](https://pages.18f.gov/agile-labor-categories/positions/product-manager/) was assigned to this project and given primary responsibility for the outcome.  The Product Manager was responsible for mobilizing the team, ensuring requirements were met, removing roadblocks, and accounting for time-restraints.  

The Product Manager was also the primary liaison between developers and product stakeholders.  The Product Manager organized a collection of users that would serve as the focus group to provide candid feedback for the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) development.

Throughout development, the Product Manager worked with the Scrum Master to groom the backlog and set priorities.  The Product Manager determined the release of the MVP as well as subsequent Operations and Maintenance (O&M) releases.
