# Criteria B - Team

####_Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team including a minimum of 5 labor categories from the Full Stack Pool labor categories to design and develop the prototype._

One of the first objectives was identifying users and product owners, and establishing the team. The team for NCIâ€™s agile application was assembled with a combination of factors in mind: experience, expertise, and efficiency.

NCI Agile Technology Sector (ATS) specializes in agile software development methodologies. For this project, we focused on gathering team members with years of experience in data-driven application development, agile practices, and open-source technologies. 

While team members specifically mapped to certain labor categories, their multi-disciplinary experience had them performing work across the development spectrum as necessary.  The team comprised of the following [labor categories](https://pages.18f.gov/agile-labor-categories/):
