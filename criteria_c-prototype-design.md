# Criteria C - Prototype & Design

#### _Understand what people need, by including people in the prototype development and design process._

The development team included a focus group of outsiders to determine how users might experience the application. This process not only allows users to voice their opinions, but also gives the development team a much needed sense of perspective on the project.  Protosketching and whiteboards were used brainstorming sessions to rapidly create mockups.

The agile process allowed the development team to pivot and use the input provided by the focus group to reconsider certain decisions regarding the usability of the site. One focus-group member suggested that the application make the most recent food recalls a more prominent image on the map, as users might want to access up-to-the-minute data to stay well informed. This informed the development team the idea of creating the Status filter option, which allows users to sort the data by Completed, Terminated, and Ongoing.

**Iterations and Feedback**

Given the short turn-around on the application, the focus group saw multiple ideas and iterations in a relatively short timeframe, allowing the development team to determine what was working successfully and what needed to be tweaked. Below is a screenshot of an earlier iteration of the application:

During the early stages of development, focus group members provided mock-up images based on how they expected the application to look, feel, and behave.

A [Google questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/a/computechinc.com/forms/d/1jn40uz9T9lDcQyWl6jqPNNP4qGuKfIIZ6V3q0FZpXmQ/viewform) was used to provide the development team a sense of context for the kinds of content users might be looking for when using the application. Additionally, in an effort to assess the usability of the application, the focus group was asked to complete five specific test scenarios.
