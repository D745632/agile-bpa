# Criteria D - Human-Centered

#### _Used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools._

At NCI, we understand the power of human-centered design (HCD). We used five HCD techniques to build the Food Recall Impact app: Survey Questionnaire, Storyboarding, Protosketching, Usability Testing, and Accessibility Testing.

**Survey Questionnaire:** 

We started exploring the needs of our users with a [survey questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/a/computechinc.com/forms/d/1jn40uz9T9lDcQyWl6jqPNNP4qGuKfIIZ6V3q0FZpXmQ/viewform) powered by Google and sent it to a sample of potential users of the FDA data. The questionnaire was designed to identify end users' needs, pain points, and requirements.

**Storyboarding:** 

The insights from the survey responses helped us solidify the idea for the potential product and an early prototype. Collaboration is central to how we work. Compelling design comes from teams not individuals. So we collaborated with the end users and the team members to create the storyboards for the prototype. These storyboards were evaluated and refined in iterations based on user feedback.

**Protosketching**

During early team meetings, [protosketching](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/06/protosketch/) was used by both Frontend and Backend Web Developers to quickly create mockups and prototypes of the API and web interface.  The protosketches were shared on a large screen so the entire team could provide feedback as the development progressed.  This allowed us to create a rough, but working, prototype during the first day of development.

**Usability Testing:** 

Sometimes users donâ€™t know or find it hard to explain their needs. So we watched and listened to our users using the early version of the functional prototype to create a [usability report](https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/attachments/FDA-Recall-App---Usability-Test-Report.pdf). What we learned from this usability testing exercise vastly improved the quality of design decisions and helped us build the right experience.

**Accessibility Testing:** 

It was also very important that the application was accessible to all users. The application was [manually reviewed](https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/attachments/NCI-BPA_A11y_Report.pdf) for accessibility in order to create a [report](https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/attachments/FDA-Recall-Impact_VPAT.pdf) of potential issues to be corrected. By using a screen reader and following best practices such as input labeling, this application achieved compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.
