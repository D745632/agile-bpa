# Criteria E - Style Guide

#### _Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library._

A comprehensive [Style Guide](http://agile-bpa.elasticbeanstalk.com/style/) was created for use in this app.  The intent was to create a style guide that could be used for any application and is meant to be used agency-wide.

This design document covers general principles, color, typography, icons, and maps.  All fonts, icons, and map data are open source and freely available.  

The Style Guide was implemented throughout the UI from the map icon colors to the FAQ text fonts, and from the header icons to the charts colors.

The color scheme was based on current agency styles in order to maintain continuity.  The Style Guide does not use any agency logo or branding to comply with logo/branding policies.
