# Criteria F - Usability Testing

#### _Performed usability tests with people._

**Usability Test Report**

Three test participants were given typical tasks to complete using the app to create a [Usability Test Report](https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/attachments/FDA-Recall-App---Usability-Test-Report.pdf). Usability experts observed, listened, and prepared this usability test report with recommendations to remediate the usability issues found during the session. The application was revised by the developers based on the recommendations and tested again with the users.

**Manual Accessibility Assessment Report**

The [Manual Accessibility Assessment Report](https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/attachments/NCI-BPA_A11y_Report.pdf) is a summary report of all accessibility issues found from a manual assessment performed by NCI's accessibility expert. This document also lists remediation recommendations which were applied by the developers to fix the accessibility issues.

**Voluntary Product Accessibility Template**

It is NCI standard to prepare a [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)](https://github.com/nci-ats/agile-bpa/blob/docs/attachments/FDA-Recall-Impact_VPAT.pdf) for all applications developed for the government. This VPAT provides a summary and detailed view of the applicable Section 508 standards and how the FDA Food Recall Impact App supports by providing accessible features.
