# Criteria G - Iterate

#### _Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype._

For the Agile Delivery BPA development effort, the NCI, Inc. team followed an iterative and incremental approach using an Agile Scrum framework.Throughout each sprint, the team functioned as a self-organized and self-governing unit that made key local decisions. 

In the effort to assure a high quality product, the team made testing a central part of the development process. Rather than testing for quality at the end (per the Waterfall approach), the team chose to build quality into the process and product. Key agile practices such as pair programming, code reviews, and automation testing were some of the steps taken to validate that the team was building the product right.

All the activities and documents that needed to be completed in support of the RFQ were captured as product backlog items. The team used an Agile tool, [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), for the management of their product backlog items. Using this tool reduced the likelihood for the team to overlook any deliverables. Some of the Agile Scrum activities/artifacts used by the team were the (1) Daily Scrum (2) Task Board (3) Sprint Burndown Chart and a (4) Prioritized Product Backlog. Evidence demonstrating the team’s use of these activities/artifacts has been captured below.
 
#####Agile Scrum Activities/Artifacts
 
######Daily Scrum 
The team conducted a Daily Scrum. The aim is for team members to come together to give an update on their progress in meeting the sprint goal. Below is a screenshot of our Daily Scrum invite.

######Task Board 
The task board is one way of communicating the sprint progress. It identifies the required set tasks to get the item done. Each task starts off in the “To Do” column. Once the team determines that they’re ready to start work on that task, they’ll place it in the “In Progress” column to show that work has begun. When the task has been completed, it will be moved to the “Completed” column.

######Sprint Burndown Chart 
The burndown chart is a visual representation of the sprint progress. It’s a helpful indicator for predicting when work will be done for the sprint.

######Prioritized Product Backlog 
The prioritized backlog seen below represents the items that the development team prioritized and intends to work on at a later time. Majority of the product backlog items (i.e. Tester feedback #1, Tester feedback #2) are feedback the team received from usability testing. The backlog items below satisfy the “DEEP” criteria. These items are Detailed appropriately Emergent Estimated and Prioritized.
