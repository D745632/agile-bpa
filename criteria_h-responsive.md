# Criteria H - Responsive

#### _Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design._

The prototype was intended to be _mobile-first_ with functionality for _touch-enabled_ devices.  The application is designed to be both functional and beautiful across a range of browsers, devices, and sizes.

Usability tests and focus groups looked at the application on multiple devices and screen sizes. Multiple browsers (IE8+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari) were tested manually as well as through tools such as SauceLabs.  Multiple devices (Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, iPad) were also tested manually and through emulators such as Google Chrome.

The web UI utilizes the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) library for responsive design across devices.  The GIS UI uses the [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.2.1/)/[Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) library for responsive maps with touch input.  [API documentation](http://agile-bpa.elasticbeanstalk.com/api-docs/) is provided through an interactive [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) interface.
